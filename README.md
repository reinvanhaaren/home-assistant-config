## Welcome

Welcome to our smart home! Me and my roommate Bas live in our house in [Hilversum][google-maps-hilversum] ![The Netherlands][flag-nl]. We started automating our home in january 2020. We recieve new devices almost every week so our home automation is growing almost every day. While this configuration extends, I'll try to keep up with the documentation. Don't forget to ðŸŒŸ this repository so you will receive updates when new features or ideas are added.

## General

### Docker

I run Home Assistant in a Docker stack next to mosquitto, zigbee2mqtt and zigbee2mqttassistant. This makes it very easy to restart, upgrade and recreate containers without migrating config and data folders. The docker-compose.yaml is included with this repository, just like the (example) configuration files for mosquitto and zigbee2mqtt. In separate containers I run MariaDB for the recorder, nginx and certbot for the reverse proxy with SSL (Let's Encrypt) and portainer to manage the stacks, containers and images. The main operating system on my machine is Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS with only Docker and Samba (for file sharing) installed.

### Home Assistant

I make use of the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS) to manage some third-party modules, [listed below](#installed-hacs-modules). For the frontend I use Bas Nijholt's [iOS Dark Mode Theme](https://github.com/basnijholt/lovelace-ios-dark-mode-theme) theme with HomeKit background 4.

## Functionality worth mentioning

### Washing machine

The usage of our washing machine is measured by a TP-Link HS110. When the washing machine is done (usage below 3 watts for more than 4 minutes) a push notification is sent to me and Bas. Besides the notification, I also soldered a nodemcu with relay board onto the start-button of the (dumb) washing machine. We can set the end time in Home Assistant and enable 'Auto-start'. The washing machine will automatically start (by close the relay for half a second) on the desired end time minus the average program duration of 1 hour and 45 minutes. When starting the washing machine the 'Auto-start' is turned off again.

### TV

We use a Tuya connected light bulb from LSC Connect (smart lighting from [Action](https://www.action.com/nl-nl/brand/lsc-smart-connect/)) to create a 'ambilight' on the white wall behind our TV. When te light in the living room is turned on, the light behind the TV is a nice purple. When you start Spotify, TuneIn Radio, Netflix or YouTube the light changes color to green or red. This works with the internal LG WEbOS-apps or with the Chromecast attached to the TV.

### Christmas Tree

We have a small christmas tree in the living room, just for fun. Why enjoy the lights in the tree in december only? There is a IKEA TRÃ…DFRI switch to turn the lights on and off.
